# Capstone_1
# Project Question/Goal

# Background + Motivation


# Description Raw Data
show list of columns & datatype --> so that way can show what I paired it down to
(might take away more columns again)
link to sources for data, how many data points (rows) etc

# EDA
Initial plotting say maybe of bar charts over time etc to see why this was important to do
show which countries or locations we want to compare and way
bring in the info about population and density now, maybe healthcare as well?

use this to go through question thought process to see how you got to final question/goal or hypothesis

# Analysis
discuss cleaning pipeline and scripts (try to put this into OOP, need if name main block)
discuss creating new database files of the cleaned data
**doing any stats?

# Future Steps
